# Reusability: we need to reuse and share code.

---

If we have two components that have similar logic & we needed to share the logic between them
mixins concept : for options api

sharing logic across components .
mixins - share logic across components - same data, methods, watchers, computed, life cycle etc

mixins folder/
alert.js file

```
export default
 data(){

  },
  methods:{},
  watchers:{}
}
```

## and in component:

```
import alertMixin from './mixins/alert.js';
export default {
  mixins: [alertMixin]
}
```

components cannot be shared across mixins.

## mixins merging:

the options exposed by mixins are merged with those in component.
Component options has more preference.

```
export default {
mixins: [alertMixin], // also had myName
  data(){
    return {
      myName: 'sdasdadas'
    }
  }
}
```

## global mixins:

logger.js

```
export default {
    mounted(){
      ...// analytics
    }
}
```

```
main.js
import loggerMixin from './loger.js'

app.mixin(loggerMixin);
```

## disadvantage for mixins:

code encapsulations make it hard to find where stuff comes from.

## Custom hooks & composition api /composable:

hooks folder/

- alert.js file

```
// start the function name with use

import { ref } from 'vue';

// accepts custom parameters

export default function useAlert(startingVisibility = false) {
const alertIsVisible = ref(startingVisibility);

function show() {
   alertIsVisible.value = true;
}

function hide() {
   alertIsVisible.value = false;
}
return {
    alertIsVisible,
    show,
    hide
 }
}
```

and in component:

```

import useAlert from './hooks/alert.js'
setup(){
   const {alertIsVisible, show, hide } = useAlert(true);
}
```

with hooks approach, we know what each hook return
With mixins, its tough to figure out because we just use the mixin name inside the array
and we dont know what all is shared from the mixin
