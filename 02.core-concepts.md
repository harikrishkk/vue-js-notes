# Vue core syntax

---

## Interpolation & Data binding:

whatever props we have in `data()`,

```
data() {
  return {
    courseGoals: "Finish the course",
    myLink: "https://www.google.com",
  };
},
```

can be bound as an expression

`<p>{{ courseGoals }}</p>` This is interpolation.

### Binding:

```
  <a v-bind:href="myLink"> Google</a>
  // or as a shortcut
  <a :href="myLink"> Google</a>
```

`{{ }} ` syntax is only available within the open/close tags.
For attributes, we use the bind syntax.

## Methods:

```
Vue.createApp({
  data(){
    return {
      courseGoals: ['A', 'B']
    }
  },
  methods: {
    outputGoal() {
      const random = Math.random();
      // we can use the "this" keyword to access anything within data()
      return random > 0.5 ? "Mastering Vue" : this.courseGoals;
    },
  }
})
```

// And use them as:

` <p>{{ outputGoal() }}</p>`

## Output raw html:

```
data() {
  return {
    myElement: "<h2> Heading 2</h2>",
  };
},

<p v-html="myElement"></p>
```

## Event binding:

```
<button v-on:click="add">+</button>
// Shortcut is:
<button @click="add">+</button>

// passing parameters
<button @click="addNumber(5)">+</button>
<button @click="subtract">-</button>

// Modifiers
<button @click.right="subtract">-</button>
<button @click.left="subtract">-</button>
<button @click.middle="subtract">-</button>

<input @input="setNumber"/>
<input @input="setNumber" @keyup.enter="someMethod"/> // Only on clicking enter.
<input @input="setNumber2($event, 'Second param')"/>
```

`<p>{{ counter }}</p>`

And in code

```
data() {
  return {
    counter: 0,
  };
},
methods: {
  add() {
    this.counter++;
  },
  addNumber(num) {
    this.counter + num;
  },
  setNumber(event){
    this.name = event.target.value
  },
  setNumber2(event, secondName){
    this.name = event.target.value + secondName
  },
  subtract() {
    this.counter--;
  },
},
```

## Event modifiers:

```
// there is stop modifier as well

@click.right => right click
@keyup.enter => click on enter key

<form :submit.prevent="submitForm">
</form>

methods: {
  submitForm(event){

  }
}
```

## Bind once:

`<p v-once> {{ counter }} </p>`

## Two way binding = Data binding + Event Binding

```
<input :value="name" @input="setName($event)">
// or
<input v-model="name" />
```

### Methods vs Computed properties:

Whenever anything on the page changes, the methods are executed.
Thats a Vue thing.

But that method may not have any property that has changed.

Computed properties can be written like methods, but they can be used like properties and they only trigger when the associated properties change.

## Computed props:

```
data() {
  return {
    counter: 0,
    name: "hari",
  };
},
computed: {
  getFullName() {
    return this.name + "Krishnan";
  },
},

<p>{{ getFullName }}</p>  // We use them as property.
```

For performance, its better to use computed properties than methods
for outputting values.
Use methods only when we know it should be called again when anything changes.

## Watchers:

Whenever a data property called name changes, please recompute them.
If we have more than one property to watch, then watchers will be tough.
computed can be a better choice.
If the counter reach 50, reset it. - Watch is good for such tasks.
eg: if we have first name & last name, then if we need to watch each of them,
watchers need two separate watchers

```
computed: {
  fullName(){
    return this.name + ' ' + this.lastName;
  }
},
watch: {
  name(value, oldValue) {
    this.fullName = value + "Krishnan";
  },
},
```

example where watcher is useful: Watcher is not directly used in template.
We can use data/computed properties to watch them.

```
watch: {
  counter(value, oldValue) {
    if(value > 50){
      this.counter = 0
    }
  },
},
```

Also we can use watch for http requests / timers.

Methods: - bind data / event binding. Executed for every re-render cycle.

Computed: used with data binding. They are re-evaluated when
their associated props change.
Use them for data that depend on other data.

Watch: Not directly used in template.
we can watch data/computed properties with them. Allows us to run code
in reaction to some changed data.

Shorthand methods:

```

v-bind:href is same as :href
v-on:click is same as @click

```

### Dynamic styling:

```
:style="{ cursor: 'pointer', borderColor: 'red'}"
:class="{demo: true, active: isSelected}"

```

Using computed, we can pass conditional classes.

```
<div :class="divClasses"

data(){
  return {
    attachRed: true
  }
},
computed: {
  divClasses() {
    return {
      red: this.attachRed,
      blue: !this.attachRed,
    };
  }
}
```

## Array syntax:

```
<div :class="['demo', { active: attachRed }]"
```

// Special property:
For custom components, **we can add props/events** and they fall through to the
root level element.

```
<base-button @click="someLogic">Click</base-button>
```

and the @click will be made part of the underlying `<button>` component.
