# Vue JS:

---

- Javascript framework / Front end Framework. ( framework gives us utility functionalities & rules )
- Build interactive & reactive web front ends. ( feel like mobile apps, react to user inputs, validations etc )
- used in browser. JS driven. Very responsive.
- SPA ( Does not fetch new HTML, but only small request for focused data. )
- Component based UI framework.
- We dont need to build things from scratch using JS. We wont introduce minor bugs when writing things from scratch.
- Focus on the business logic.
- Gives us rules & tools.
- Declarative way of writing.
