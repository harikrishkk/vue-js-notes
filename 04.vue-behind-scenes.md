# Vue behind the scenes

---

Reactivity is built on top of Proxy and set which listens for property changes
and react to them automatically.

We can have multiple apps per page. But they cant communicate with each other.
Or SPAs

## Ref:

```
<input ref="userText"/> detects and stores internally.

methods: {
    getMessage(){
        this.message = this.$refs.userText.value
    }
}
```

Vue uses Virtual DOM. It keeps a virtual copy of the real DOM
which is managed entirely in Javascript & in memory.
Imagine a Javascript object
When something changes, a new VDOM is created.
The difference between those 2 is rendered to real DOM.

A vue template is rendered in the DOM.
It uses Virtual DOM.
The delta of VDOM is written to real DOM.
