# Vue components - Single File components:

---

Components are great when we need to reuse and encapsulate
certain functionality.

If we have a repeating list , then each list item can be a component
that encapsulates its functionality.

## Create a component: Option 1:

```
const app = Vue.createApp({

});
```

## On the app instance

```
app.component('app-header', {
  template: `  `,
  data(){
  },
  methods: {
  }
})
```

and use them as ` <app-header></app-header>`

Now, each component is stand alone instances.

```
app.mount("#user-goal");
```
