# Parent to child communication:

---

```
v-for="item in items"
  :key="item.id"
  :details="item"  <--- pass data down as props. ( Note, we need the v-bind to make them dynamic)
  app-heading="'My title'"   <--- pass data down as props.
  @toggle-favorite="someMethod"   <--- Emit custom event from the component.


methods: {
  someMethod(id){

  }
}
```

what we pass as snake-case (app-heading) is accepted as camelCase (appHeading)
props should not be mutated. If we accept a prop and try to mutate, we get error.
It is against uni-directional data flow concepts.
Here, add a data property & we can have a local property and assign them to input.

```
<script>
 export default {
     props: ['details', 'appHeading'],
     // or if we need to add propTypes,
     props: {
         name: {
             type: String,
             required: true
         },
         email: {
             type: String,
             required: false,
             default: '0',     <-- default can be added if required set to false.
             validator: function(value){
                 return value === '1' || value === '0'
             }
         },
         appHeading: String,
     },
     emits:['toggle-favorite'],
     // or an object
     emits: {
         'toggle-favorite': function(id){
            if(id){
                return true;
            }else {
                return false;
            }
         }
     }
     data(){

     }
 }
</script>
```

## Emit custom events:

```
this.$emit('toggle-favorite', this.id)
```

## Prop fallthrough & event fallthrough

We can use props and events on a component that doesn't define it.
Props and events added on a custom component tag automatically
fall through to the root component in the template of that component.
They can be accessed via `$attrs `

```
<template>
  <button>
    <slot></slot>
  </button>
</template>

<script> export default {} </script>
```

Use them as:

```
<base-button
   type="submit"
   @click="doSomething">Click me</base-button>


<form @submit.prevent="submitForm"></form>
```

Problem with bigger apps when passing data down multiple levels:
Prop drilling (in react )

## Provide and inject:

```
export default {
    data(){

    },
    methods: {

    },
    //For providing data, we need to use the provide option.
    // This works only for static data.
    provide: {
        users: []
    },
    //or if we need to provide data that changes over time,
    // use the function syntax of provide.
    provide(){
        return {
           users: this.users,
           selectItem: this.selectItemHandler
        }
    }
}
```

and in the component where we need those:
we can only provide what has been injected in a higher up level.
provide and inject needs the parent child hierarchy.

```

export default {
    inject: ['users']
}

```

## For emitting the event back to the parent,

```
<button @click="selectItem(id)"></button>
@submit.prevent for forms.

export default {
    inject: ['selectItem']   <- this is a function that gets executed upon click
}

```

and in the component where we have used the provide,

```
provide(){
   selectItem: this.selectItem
},
methods: {
   selectItem(id) {

   }
}
```

They should not be used for direct parent child.
It is used to avoid pass through component scenarios
